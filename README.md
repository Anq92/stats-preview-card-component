### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS

### What I learned

It was my first project where the position of elements actually varies on different screen sizes and keeping everything in the right place was quite difficult. I had a chance to practice media queries.

### Continued development

I'll continue to learn SASS to keep everything in order and I'm going to use some Javascript in my next projects.
